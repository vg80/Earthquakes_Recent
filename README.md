# Earthquakes_Recent
The project focus is on creating a visualization using R of past 30 days earthquake's epicenter and the number of earthquakes at the location. 

To complete this, data was collected from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/, from JSON files which keeps on modifying data after every 15 minutes.

The maps show the locations nearest to the epicenters and the number of earthquakes of magnitude >4.5 in past 30 days.
